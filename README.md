# Signal-LTS: Luke T. Shumaker's modified version of Signal private messenger

Hi, I'm Luke T. Shumaker.  This is my modified version of Signal
private messenger.

I use this as my daily driver; so even if I lag behind a bit on
merging new versions of Signal, you can be reasonably confident that I
won't lag behind so much that things stop working.

## User-visible differences from the standard version of Signal

Bug fixes:

 - Non-UTF-8 locales now work correctly.  Or at least the tests pass
   for non-UTF-8 locales.

## Switching from the standard version of Signal

1. Install the F-Droid app store from f-droid.org

2. In F-Droid, go to "Settings" (lower-right) -> "Repositories" (near
   the top) -> "+" in the upper right, and enter
   https://fdroid.lukeshu.com/repo

3. In Signal, go to hamburger -> "Settings" -> "Chats" -> "Backups"
   and make a backup, and ensure you know what the backup password is
   and what your PIN is.

4. Uninstall Signal.

5. In F-Droid, do a search for Signal, and Signal-LTS should show
   up.  Install it.

6. Open Signal, and restore from the backup.

7. In the Signal app info (from Android settings, or by long-holding
   on the Signal app icon), set it to be the default SMS app.  There
   is currently **not** an option to do that from within Signal itself
   (TODO).

8. (maybe?) If you had any connected devices, you may need to set
   those back up??

## Developer-visible differences from the standard version of Signal

 - Stricter `.editorconfig`, and compliance with it; so that you don't
   need to reconfigure your editor on a file-by-file basis.

 - `./gradlew qa` now works and passes on non-UTF-8 locales (a notable
   instance of which is the reproducible-builds Docker image), so that
   you can get better automated feedback.

 - `./gradlew test` now works, so you can get better automated
   feedback.

 - `./gradlew qa` no longer depends on `clean`, so it won't take
   forever anymore.

 - Can now be published to an F-Droid repo.  It now builds a universal
   APK rather than building separate APKs for each CPU architecture.
   This is arguably a downgrade for the user-experience, as the user
   will have larger files to download; but, F-Droid doesn't support
   split APKs, so this is necessary for being able to publish it as an
   F-Droid repo.
